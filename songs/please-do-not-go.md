   G                                      C     D
   Tell your man I'm stuck on this lovely girl
   G                             C      D

   BRIDGE:
   -------
   C                        G
   How long can the days go on
   C                   G
    When my love is so strong
   C                           G
    And I know I cannot tell a lie
   C                   D
    I wanna see him go by, bye, bye bye, bye bye bye bye
   
   
   VERSE 2: [play like verse 1]
   --------
   And I wonder, I wonder what she would say
   If I told her, if I told her that I felt this way
   You know it might make a turn, might make a turn,
   might make a turn either way
   So all I can do is patiently pray, pray, I pray pray pray
   
   
   CHORUS: [play like first chorus]
   -------
   Said please, please, please do not go
   Please, please, please do not go
   Please, please, please do not go
   Please, please, please do not go
   
   
   BASS-SOLO:
   ----------
   No way in hell can I transcribe this solo. Besides, this is a
   guitar tab, not a bass tab. The solo is basically a variation
   on the main bassline, look at the bottom of the file to see
   the basslines for the song.
   
   
   BRIDGE: [play like first bridge]
   -------
   How long can the days go on
   When my love is so strong
   And I know I cannot tell a lie
   Oh, whoh, whoh, I wanna see him go by, bye, bye bye, bye bye bye bye
   
   
   VERSE 3: [play like verses 1 & 2]
   --------
   I tell you man, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
   And you know I could travel, I could travel over the whole world
   And you know what she does, she turn around, she turn around
   she like another guy
   Oh what can I do, I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry
   
   
   CHORUS: [play like previous choruses]
   -------
   Please, please, please do not go
   Please, please, please do not go
   Please, please, please do not go, oh oh
   Please, please, please do not go, oh
   Please, please, please, you hurt me, so
   Please, please, please, you hurt me, so
   Please, please, please I got something to, show...
   [fade out]
   
   
                     B A S S L I N E S:
   
   / = slide up    p = pull-off
   
   
   The INTRO is just this:
   
   G|-----------------|
   D|-2h3--2----------|
   A|--------5---1/2--| Then go straight away into the VERSE-BASSLINE.
   E|-----------------|
   
   
   OK, here's the VERSE-BASSLINE:
        G                     C           D
   G|-------------------------------------------------------|
   D|-------------5--5-3-2-------------------3p2---2--------|
   A|-------1/2-5----------5--3--2--3--0--5------5---0h2----|
   E|---3---------------------------------------------------|
   
   and sometimes, like the end of the verse, it goes like this:
   
        G                     C           D
   G|--------------------------------------------------|
   D|-------------5--5-3-2-----------------------------|
   A|-------1/2-5----------5--3--2--3--0--5--3--2--0---|
   E|---3----------------------------------------------|
   
   
   Now the CHORUS-BASSLINE:
       G                   C           D
   G|-------------------------------------------------|
   D|--5----3----2------------------------------------|
   A|-----------------5----3--2--3--0--5--3--2--0-----|
   E|-------------------------------------------------|
   
   
   And finally, the BRIDGE-BASSLINE:
       C                 G
   G|---------------------------------------------|
   D|---------------------------------2-----------|
   A|--3---2---0------------2-----5-5-----5--2----|
