Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know

That something wasn't right here
Am               E                      C
Oh baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go

And now you're out of sight, yeah
Am              E
Show me how you want it to be

Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now, oh because

Chorus
Am               E
My loneliness is killing me (and I)

I must confess I still believe (still believe)
Am                           E
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
          C
Give me a sign

Hit me baby one more time
