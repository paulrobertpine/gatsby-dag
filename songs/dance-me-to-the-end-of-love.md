[Verse 1]
Am
Dance me to your beauty
       Em
With a burning violin
Am
Dance me through the panic
         Em  
Till I'm gathered safely in
Am
Lift me like an olive branch
    Em
And be my homeward dove
B7                     Em
Dance me to the end of love
B7                  Em7add11 Em
Dance me to the end of love


[Verse 2]
Am
Let me see your beauty
         Em
When the witnesses are gone
Am
Let me feel you moving
          Em
Like they do in Babylon
Am
Show me slowly what I only
Em
Know the limits of
B7                     Em
Dance me to the end of love
B7                  Em7add11 Em
Dance me to the end of love


[Verse 3]
Am
Dance me to the wedding now
Em
Dance me on and on
Am
Dance me very tenderly and
Em
Dance me very long
      Am
We're both of us beneath our love
      Em
We're both of us above
B7                     Em
Dance me to the end of love
B7                  Em7add11 Em
Dance me to the end of love


[Verse 4]
Am
Dance me to the children
        Em
Who are asking to be born
Am
Dance me through the curtains
         Em
That our kisses have outworn
Am
Raise a tent of shelter now
       Em
Though every thread is torn
B7                  Em7add11 Em
Dance me to the end of love


[Verse 5]
Am
Dance me to your beauty
       Em
With a burning violin
Am
Dance me through the panic
         Em
Till I'm gathered safely in
Am
Touch me with your naked hand
Em
Touch me with your glove
B7                     Em
Dance me to the end of love
B7                  Em7add11 Em
Dance me to the end of love
