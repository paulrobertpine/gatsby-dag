Am
Dance me to your beauty
\    Em
With a burning violin
Am
Dance me through the panic
\    Em  
Till I'm gathered safely in
Am
Lift me like an olive branch
\   G
And be my homeward dove
B7                     Em
Dance me to the end of love
B7                     Em
Dance me to the end of love

Let me see your beauty
When the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving
Like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only
Know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love


Dance me to the wedding now
Dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and
Dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love
We're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love


Dance me to the children
Who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains
That our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now
Though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love


Dance me to your beauty
With a burning violin
Dance me through the panic
Till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand
Touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
