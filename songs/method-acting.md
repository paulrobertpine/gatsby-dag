        Em                                Bm7
There's no beginning to the story, a bookshelf sinks into the sand
     C                                        G  F#/D
And a language learned and forgot, in turn, is studied once again
      Em                                    Bm7
It's a shocking bit of footage viewed from a shitty TV screen
       C                               G  F#/D
You can squint out into snowy static to make out the meaning
           Em                                Bm7
And keep on stretching the antenna hoping that it will come clear
            C                                 G  F#/D
We need some reception, a higher message, just tell us what to fear

      Am      D         G  F#/D      Em
'Cause I don't know what tomorrow brings
    Am     D               G  F#/D    Em
It's alive with such possibilities
Am    D              G      F#/D     Cmaj7
All I know is I feel better when I sing
           B+
Burdens are lifted from me
                 Em   Bm7 C G F#/D
That's my voice rising

Em Bm7 C G F#/D Em Bm7 C G F#/D

            Em                                      Bm7
So, Michael, please keep the tape rolling, boys keep strumming those guitars
         C                                    G  F#/D
We need a record of our failures, yes, we must document our love
    Em                                     Bm7
I've sat too long in my silence, I've grown too old in my pain
  C                                    G  F#/D
To shed this skin, be born again, it starts with an ending

  Am         D                G  F#/D  Em
So thank you, friends, for the time we shared
       Am          D           G  F#/D   Em
My love stays with you like sunlight and air
            Am     D                 G       F#/D      Cmaj7
And though I truly wish I could keep hanging around here
         B+
My joy is covering me
                 Em  Bm7 C G F#/D
Soon, I will disappear

Em Bm7 C G F#/D

C
It's not a movie
Em
No private screening
Am
This method acting
        D
Well, I call that living
  C
It's like a fountain
Em
A door has opened
Am
We have a problem
     D
With no solution
      Cmaj7             B+
But to love and to be loved

  Am        D              G   F#/D   Em
So I've made peace with the falling leaves
     Am          D          G   F#/D Em
I see their same fate in my own body
           Am      D              G      F#/D         Cmaj7
But I won't be frightened when I'm awoken from this dream
     B+
And returned to that which
             Em Bm7 C G F#/D
Gave birth to me     

Em Bm7 C G F#/D
Gave birth to me
Gave birth to me
Gave birth to me
And the story goes
And the story goes
And it goes on and on and on and on
It's going on and on and on and on
