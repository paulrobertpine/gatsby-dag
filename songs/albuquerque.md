Well they [Em]say that Santa [D]Fe 
     Em                     D 
it's less than ninety miles away 
             Em             G                 A 
and I've got time to roll a number and rent a car 
   G        Em      D 
Oh Alaaaalllal  - buquerque
     
          Em              D
I've been flying down the road 
              Em             D
and I've been starving to be alone 
    Em               G               A 
Independent from the scene that I've known 
G        Em      D 
Alaaaalllal  - buquerque 

(solos on verse)
  
        Em          D
So I'll stop when I can 
          Em                     D
Find some fried eggs and country ham
          Em                   G                A
I'll find somewhere where they don't care who I am
   G        Em      D 
Oh Alaaaalllal  - buquerque x2
