          Em             D 
Well they say that Santa Fe 
     Em                      D 
it's less than ninety miles away 
            Em             G                 A 
and i've got time to roll a number and rent a car 
   G       Em      D 
Oh Al[aaaalll  - buquerque 

     
          Em              D
I've been flying down the road 
              Em             D
and I've been starving to be alone 
     Em               G               A 
-Independent from the scene that I've known 
   G       Em      D 
Oh Al[aaaalll  - buquerque   

(solos)
  
        Em          D
So I'll stop when I can 
          Em                     D
Find some fried eggs and country ham
          Em                   G                A
I'll find somewhere where they don't care who I am
   G            Em      D 
Oh Alaaaalll  - buquerque
