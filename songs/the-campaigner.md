Verse
F
I am a lonely visitor.
   Bb
I came too late to cause a stir,
          F                 Dm                Bb
though I campaigned all my life towards that goal.
                    A7
I hardly slept the night you wept;
Dm                    Dm/C
our secret's safe and still well kept
C                                 Dm
where even Richard Nixon has got soul.
Bb                          C   Dm  Bb  Dm  G
Even Richard Nixon has got soul.
Verse
   F
Traffic cops are all color blind.
 Bb
People steal from their own kind.
  F               Dm           Bb
Evening comes to early for a stroll.
                        A7
Down neon streets the streaker streaks.
Dm                           Dm/C
The speaker speaks, but the truth still leaks,
 C                                Dm
where even Richard Nixon has got soul.
Verse
 F
The podium rocks in the crowded waves.
 Bb
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves
 F                  Dm                    Bb
that went down long before he played this role
                              A7
for the hotel queens and the magazines,
 Dm                  Dm/C
test tube genes and slot machines
  Bb                         C        Dm    Bb  Dm  G
where even Richard Nixon has got it, soul.
Verse
 F
Hospitals have made him cry,
 Bb
but there's always a free way in his eye,
 F                              Dm             Bb
though his beach just got too crowded for his stroll.
                         A7
Roads stretch out like healthy veins,
Dm                    Dm/C
and wild gift horses strain the reins,
 C                                Dm
where even Richard Nixon has got soul.
Bb                          C   Dm  Bb  G  Bb  A7  Dm
Even Richard Nixon has got soul.
Verse
 F
I am a lonely visitor.
 Bb
I came too late to cause a stir,
 F                          Dm                Bb
though I campaigned all my life towards that goal.
