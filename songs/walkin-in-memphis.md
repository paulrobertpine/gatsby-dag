[Verse 1]

   F   G     C          Am
   Put on my blue suede shoes
         F    G      C    Am 
   And I boarded the plane 
   F                   G           C     Am
   Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues 
   F                    G       C   Am  
   In the middle of the pouring rain
   F G  C     Am F                   G    C Am 
   W.C. Handy -- won't you look down over me 
   F            G       C         Am
   Yeah I got a first class ticket 
              F         G       C 
   But I'm as blue as a boy can be 


   [Chorus]

   C        Am         F      G         C
   Then I'm walking in Memphis 
   Am              F        G           C
   Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale 
   Am         F             G           C
   Walking in Memphis 
   Am              F              G     Gsus
   But do I really feel the way I feel? 


   [Verse 2]

   F       G        C    Am
   Saw the ghost of Elvis 
   F  G     C  Am
   On Union Avenue
   F            G         C        Am 
   Followed him up to the gates of Graceland 
          F           G          C      Am
   Then I watched him walk right through 
         F           G       C      Am
   Now security they did not see him 
             F        G         C   Am
   They just hovered 'round his tomb 
                 F             G      C               Am
   But there's a pretty little thing, Waiting for the King 
   N.C.
   Down in the Jungle Room 


   [Chorus]

   C        Am         F      G         C
   Then I'm walking in Memphis 
   Am              F        G           C
   Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale 
   Am         F             G           C
   Walking in Memphis 
   Am              F              G     Gsus
   But do I really feel the way I feel?

   [Bridge]

               Csus4          C     Csus4 C
   They've got catfish on the table 
               Csus4         C      Csus4 C
   They've got gospel in the air 
                      E7         F
   And Reverend Green be glad to see you 
            F#dim         G7        C/G   C
   When you haven't got a prayer 
   NC.                            F       G  C  Am   
   But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis 


   [Verse 3]

   F          G     C    Am
   Now Muriel plays piano 
   F     G             C    Am
   Every Friday at the Hollywood 
   F        G                  C      Am
   And they brought me down to see her 
   F        G             C    Am
   And they asked me if I would
   F    G      C     Am 
   Do a little number 
         F         G      C    Am
   And I sang with all my might
                  F           G     C         Am 
   And she said, "Tell me are you a Christian child?" 
   N.C.
   And I said "Ma'am I am tonight" 


   [Chorus]

   C        Am         F      G         C
   Then I'm walking in Memphis 
   Am              F        G           C
   Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale 
   Am         F             G           C
   Walking in Memphis 
   Am              F              G     Gsus
   But do I really feel the way I feel? 


   [Ending]

   F   G     C          Am
   Put on my blue suede shoes
         F    G      C    Am 
   And I boarded the plane 
   F                   G           C     Am
   Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues 
   F                    G       C   Am  
   In the middle of the pouring rain
   F                   G           C     Am
   Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues 
   F                    G       C   Am  
   In the middle of the pouring rain
