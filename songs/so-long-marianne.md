[Verse 1]

 A Bm

Come over to the window, my little darling

D A

I'd like to try to read your palm


G D

I used to think I was some sort of gypsy boy

F#m E Esus4 E E7

before I let you take me home

[Chorus]

 A F#m

Now so long, Marianne, It's time that we began

 E Esus4 E E7 E Esus4 E E7 A Asus4

to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

[Verse 2]

 A Bm


Well you know that I love to live with you

D A

but you make me forget so very much

G D

 forget to pray for the angels

 F#m E sus4 E E7

nd then the angels forget to pray for us

[Chorus]

 A F#m

ow so long, Marianne, It's time that we began

 E Esus4 E E7 E Esus4 E E7 A Asus4

o laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

[Verse 3]

 A Bm

We met when we were almost young

D A

deep in the green lilac park

G D

You held on to me like I was a crucifix

F#m E Esus4 E E7

s we went kneeling through the dark

[Chorus]

 A F#m

ow so long, Marianne, It's time that we began

 E Esus4 E E7 E Esus4 E E7 A Asus4

o laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

[Verse 4]

 A Bm

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now

D A

then why do I feel so alone

G D

'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web

 F#m E Esus4 E E7

s fastening my ankle to a stone

[Chorus]

 A F#m

ow so long, Marianne, It's time that we began

 E Esus4 E E7 E Esus4 E E7 A Asus4

o laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

[Verse 5]

 A Bm

For now I need your hidden love

D A

I'm cold as a new razor blade

G D

You left when I told you I was curious

F#m E Esus4 E E7

 never said that I was brave

[Chorus]

 A F#m

ow so long, Marianne, It's time that we began

 E Esus4 E E7 E Esus4 E E7 A Asus4

o laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

[Verse 6]

 A Bm

Oh, you are really such a pretty one

D A

I see you've gone and changed your name again

G D

nd just when I climbed this whole mountainside

 F#m E Esus4 E E7

o wash my eyelids in the rain

[Chorus]

 A F#m

ow so long, Marianne, It's time that we began

 E Esus4 E E7 E Esus4 E E7 A Asus4

to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

A Bm

Oh, your eyes, well, I forget your eyes

D A

your body's at home in every sea

G D

How come you gave away your news to everyone

F#m E Esus4 E E7

that you said was a secret to me
