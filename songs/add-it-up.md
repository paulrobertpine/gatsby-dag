Verse]



   B5

   Why can't I get just one kiss(2x)

   A

   believe me there'd be some things that I wouldn't miss

\    B5 (stop abruptly)

   but I look at your pants and I need a kiss





\[Verse]



   Why can't I get just one screw(2x)

   believe me I'd know what to do

   but something won't let me make love to you





\[Interlude]



At this point there's a little interlude that's dominated melodically by the

bass. The guitar in the background plays something similar to the verse

figure. Feel free to post it if you want to take the time to figure it out.





\[Verse]



   Why can't I get just one fuck(2x)

   I guess it's got something to do with luck

   but I waited my whole life for just one





\[Chorus]



   B5                       A                  B5

   Day...after day...I get angry...and I will say...that the day...is in my

\    A               B5

   sight...when I take a bow...and say goodnight





\[Verse] 

(palm muted)



   Mo my momma momma mo my mum

   Have you kept your eye your eye on your son

   I know you've had problems your not the only one

   but when your sugar left he left you on the run



   Mo my momma momma mo my mum

   take a look now what your boy has done

   he's walking around like he's number one

   he went downtown and he got him a gun



   Don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me

   You know you got my sympathy

   but don't shoot shoot shoot that thing at me

\[Guitar solo]

   In your broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs

   Can I mix in with your affairs

   Share a smoke

   Make a joke

   Grasp and reach for a leg of hope



   Words to memorize

   Words hypnotize

   Words make my mouth exercise

   Words all fail the magic prize

   Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs



   Mo my momma momma mo my mother

   I would love to love you lover

   The city's restless it's ready to pounce

   it go here in your bedroom ounce for ounce



   Said I'm giving you a decision to make

   Things to lose, things to take

   Just as she was about ready to cut it up

   She said wait a minute honey I'm gonna Add it up



   I'm gonna Add it up Add it up

   See what you got you gotta  Add it up

   Day after day

   I get angry and I will say

   that the day is in my sight

   when I take a bow and say goodnight

   goodnight
