[Verse 1]

A     C#m                                  D               Dm
Ruby, let down your golden hair,  when I’m standing at the bottom of your stairs
A     C#m                            D                 Dm
Ruby, I can see your TV on,  But the people there they flicker and they’re gone
   D                                A         D                                    E
So let down your golden hair for me tonight,  Let down your golden hair for me to climb


[Chorus]

             A                 D      A                                E
Just like an old-time telegraph man,  I came here with a simple job to do
             A                         D              Dm 
Cause that news coming down the wire says that your head’s on fire
        A               E       D          A
And I'm trying to get a message through to you


[Verse 2]

A     C#m                            D                Dm
Ruby, you ain't lonely yet With your crystal and your Russian cigarette
A     C#m                                    D                    Dm
Ruby, haven't you heard before,  what good’s finest tower when it hasn't got a door?
D                                   A         D                                    E
So let down your golden hair for me tonight,  Let down your golden hair for me to climb


[Chorus]

             A                  D     A                                E
Just like an old-time telegraph man,  I came here with a simple job to do
             A                         D              Dm
Cause that news coming down the wire says that your bed’s on fire
        A               E       D          A
And I'm trying to get a message through to you


[Instrumental]

A          C#m     D     Dm      A     C#m     D     Dm     D     A     D     E
Ruby


[Chorus]

         A                  D     A                                E
I’m that old-time telegraph man,  I came here with a simple job to do
             A                         D              Dm
Cause that news coming down the wire says that your wheels’s on fire
        A               E       D          A
And I'm trying to get a message through to you


[Outro]

           A                         D              Dm
Cause that news coming down the wire says that your world’s on fire
        A               E       D          A
And I'm trying to get a message through to you
