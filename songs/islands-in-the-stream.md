[Intro]
|C       |F C     | x2

[Verse]
[C]Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
[C]I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb.
I was [F]soft inside, there was something goin' [C]on[F][C]
[C]You do something to me that I can't explain
[C]  Hold me closer and I feel no pain, ev'ry [F]beat of my heart
We got something goin' o[C]n

[Pre-Chorus]
Tender love is [Fmaj7]blind, it requires a dedication
[Fm]All this love we feel needs no conversation
We [C]ride it together, uh huh
Makin' l[C]ove with each other, uh huh

[Chorus]
Islands in [C]the stream, that is what [F]we are
No one in [Dm]between, how can we be wrong
Sail away [C]with me to ano[F]ther world
And we re[C]ly on each other, uh huh
From one l[Dm]over to another, uh [C]huh

[Verse]
[G#]I can't live without you if the love was gone
[G#]Ev'rything is nothing if you got no one
And you did [C#]walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the [G#]real thing[C#][G#]
But [G#]that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
[G#]Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the [C#]message is clear, this could be the year
For the [G#]real thing

[Pre-Chorus]
No more will you [C#maj7]cry. Baby I will hurt you never
We [C#m]start and end as one in love forever we can
[G#]Ride it together, uh huh
Makin' l[G#]ove with each other, uh huh

[Chorus]
Islands in [G#]the stream, that is what [C#]we are
No one in [A#m]between, how can we be wrong
Sail away [G#]with me to ano[C#]ther world
And we re[G#]ly on each other, uh huh
From one l[A#m]over to another, uh [G#]huh

[Bridge]
[C#]     [E]    [G#]Sail away
[C#]   I can [E]sail away. Be [G#]with me

[Chorus]
Islands in [G#]the stream, that is what [C#]we are
No one in [A#m]between, how can we be wrong
Sail away [G#]with me to ano[C#]ther world
And we re[G#]ly on each other, uh huh
From one l[A#m]over to another, uh [G#]huh
Islands in [G#]the stream, that is what [C#]we are
No one in [A#m]between, how can we be wrong
Sail away [G#]with me to ano[C#]ther world
And we re[G#]ly on each other, uh huh
From one l[A#m]over to another, uh [G#]huh
