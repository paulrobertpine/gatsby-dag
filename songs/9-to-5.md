VERSE:1
 D
 Tumble outta bed and a`stumble to the kitchen
 G
 Pour myself a cup of ambition
 D                                        A
 And yawn n` stretch n` and try to come to life
 D
 Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin`
 G
 Out on the streets the traffic starts jumpin`
     D                    A           D 
 With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
 
 CHORUS:
         G
 Workin` 9 to 5 - what a way to make a livin`
        D
 Barely gettin` by - it`s all takin` and no givin`
          G
They just use your mind - and they never give you credit
      E                  A
 It`s enough to drive you crazy if you let it
 G
 9 to 5 - for service and devotion
          D
 You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
        G
 Want to move ahead but the boss won`t seem to let me
   E                         A             D
 I swear sometimes that man is out to get me mmmmmmm
 
 VERSE:2
 D
 They let you dream just to watch `em shatter
        G
 You`re just a step on the boss man`s ladder
     D                                A
 But you got dreams he`ll never take away
 D
 In the same boat with a lot of your friends
 G
 Waitin` for the day your ship`ll come in
         D                          A                  D
 And the tide`s gonna turn an` it`s all gonna roll your way
 
 CHORUS:
         G
 Workin` 9 to 5 - what a way to make a livin`
        D
 Barely gettin` by - it`s all takin` and no givin`
           G
 They just use your mind - and you never get the credit
      E                  A
 It`s enough to drive you crazy if you let it
 G
 9 to 5, yeah - they got you where they want you
           D
 There`s a better life - and you think about it don`t you
        G
 It`s a rich man`s game - no matter what they call it
         E                      A
 And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
