Intro 
[F] [C] [G] (x2)

I[G] had a real good mot[F]her and fat[C]her
and they surely stood the t[G]est
and now they're in bright gl[C]ory
and are sle[G]eping on [C]the savio[D]ur's bre[G]ast

They set a good exa[F]mple for m[C]e
and they taught me how to pr[G]ay
now I truly conve[C]rted
and walkin[G]g on t[C]he narr[D]ow wa[G]y

I know that if I cannot meet th[F]em on h[C]igh
then how lonely I will be[G]
for what good is my journ[C]ey
if I miss [G]out o[C]n eter[D]nity[G]

I had a real good mot[F]her and fath[C]er
and they surely stood the t[G]est
and now they're in bright gl[C]ory
and sleepi[G]ng on [C]the saviour[D]'s bre[G]ast
