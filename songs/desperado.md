G   G7              C             Cm
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses?
         G   G/F     Em        A7      D7
You been out ridin' fences for so long now.
             G        G7
Oh, you're a hard one, 
                C                Cm
But I know that you've got your reasons. 
      G          G/F#    Em
These things that are pleasin' you, 
    A7       D7       G   D/F#
Can hurt you somehow.
Chorus
          Em                Bm
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy,
       C                 G    G/F#
She'll beat you if she's able.
         Em                   C              G     D/F#
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet.
       Em                Bm
Now it seems to me, some fine things, 
          C              G  
Have been laid upon your table. 
        A7                                  Dsus4   D
But you only want the things that you can't get.
Verse 2
     G   G7              C             Cm
Desperado, oh, you ain't gettin' no younger: 
         G   G/F#   Em       A7       D7
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home. 
          G        G7
And freedom, oh freedom,
                C                Cm
Well, that's just some people talkin' 
      G     G/F#    Em
Your prison is walking,
    A7       D7       G   D/F#
Through this world all alone.
Chorus
          Em                Bm
And don't your feet get cold in the winter time? 
       C                 G    G/F#
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine 
         Em              C              G     D/F#
It's hard to tell the night time from the day 
       Em                Bm
You're loosin' all your highs and lows 
          C              G  
Ain't it funny how the feeling,
        A7       Dsus4   D
Goes away?
Verse 3
     G   G7              C             Cm
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses? 
     G         G/F#    Em        A7       D7
Come down from your fences, and open the gate 
          G      G7              C         Cm
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you, 
           G       G/F#   Em
You better let somebody love you,
           C       G/B  A7 
You better let somebody love you,
           G       B7   Em 
You better let somebody love you, 
(C)         D7        G
Before it's too late.
