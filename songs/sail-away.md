Intro

 G Am D G

\    

Verse 1

 G                     Am    

 I could live inside a teepee

 D                        G          

 I could die in penthouse thirty-five

 G                        Am     

 You could lose me on the freeway

 D                         C     G   

 But I would still make it back alive

Chorus

 D                       G  

 As long as we can sail away

 D                       C D

 As long as we can sail away

\    G                 

 There'll be wind in the canyon

 Am              

 Moon on the rise

 C          D            G  

 As long as we can sail away

Verse 2

 See the losers in the best bars

 Meet the winners in the dives

 Where the people are the real stars

 All the rest of their lives

\    

Chorus

 D                       G  

 As long as we can sail away

 D                       C D

 As long as we can sail away

\    G                 

 There'll be wind in the canyon

 Am              

 Moon on the rise

 C          D            G  

 As long as we can sail away

Verse 3

 There's a road stretched out between us

 Like a ribbon on the high plain

 Down from Phoenix through Salinas

 'Round the bend and back again

\    

Chorus

 D                       G  

 As long as we can sail away

 D                       C D

 As long as we can sail away

\    G                 

 There'll be wind in the canyon

 Am              

 Moon on the rise

 C          D            G  

 As long as we can sail away
