Call your [C]girlfriend[G]
It's time you [C]had the tal[G]k
Give your [C]reason[G]s
Say it's [C]not [G]her [Em]fault
But [D]you just [C]met some[G]body [D]new

Tell her not to get up[Em]set, second-guessing [D]everything you said and [G]done
And then when she gets u[C]pset tell her how y[Em]ou never meant to hurt [D]no one

Then you tell her that the [G]only way her [D]heart will mend is [Em]when she learns
To [C]love again
And it w[G]on't make sense right n[D]ow but you're still her [Em]friend
And then you [D]let her down e[C]asy

But [D]you just [C]met some[G]body [D]new

Don't you tell her how[Em] I give you something that you [D]never even knew you [G]missed
Don't you even try and e[C]xplain how it's so [Em]different when we [D]kiss

Then you tell her that the [G]only way her [D]heart will mend is [Em]when she learns
To [C]love again
And it w[G]on't make sense right n[D]ow but you're still her [Em]friend
And then you [D]let her down e[C]asy
