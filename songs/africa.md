[Intro]
F   Am   x4

[Verse 1]
G                   Bm      Em
I hear the drums echoing tonight
G                 F             Am          Em    F  Am
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
G                Bm            Em           G
She's coming in twelve thirty flight   the moonlit wings
F                      Am7               Em    F  Am
Reflect the stars that guide me toward salva-tion
G              Bm              Em
I stopped an old man along the way
G                    F             Am               Em    F Am
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melo-dies
G              Bm        Em                  F                Am
He turned to me as if to say hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

[Chorus]
Dm            A#              F       C
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Dm                      A#            F             C
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do       
Dm           A#          F  C
I bless the rains down in  Africa
Dm              A#              F        Am  C Dm  C F Am
Gonna take some time to do the things we never  had

[Verse 2]
G             Bm             Em
The wild dogs cry out in the night
G                     F                Am       Em    F  Am
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
G           Bm               Em
I know that I must do what's right
G                      F          Am                Em     F  Am
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
G         Bm                 Em
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Em                 F                   Am
Frightened of this thing that I've become

[Chorus]
Dm          A#            F       C
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Dm                    A#            F             C
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Dm         A#            F  C
I bless the rains down in  Africa
Dm            A#             F        Am  C Dm  C    F Am
Gonna take some time to do the things we never  had

[Bridge]
G  B7   Em               F              Am
          hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

[Outro/Chorus]
Dm          A#            F       C
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Dm                    A#            F             C
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Dm         A#            F  C
I bless the rains down in  Africa
Dm         A#            F  C
I bless the rains down in  Africa
Dm         A#            F  C
I bless the rains down in  Africa
Dm         A#            F  C
I bless the rains down in   Africa
Dm         A#            F  C
I bless the rains down in  Africa

[Outro]
Dm            A#             F        Am  C Dm   F Am
Gonna take some time to do the things we never  had
