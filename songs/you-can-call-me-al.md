[Verse]

G            D
A man walks down the street,
       C          D
he says why am I soft in the middle now,
G         D
why am I soft in the middle,
C               D
the rest of my life is so hard,
G          D
I need a photo-opportunity,
C                   D
I want a shot at redemption,
G                      D
dont want to end up a cartoon,
    C          D
in a cartoon graveyard,
 G           D
bonedigger, bonedigger,
C             D
dogs in the moonlight,
G     D      C        D
far away my well-lit door,
     G          D
Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly,
 C                D
get these mutts away from me,
      G           D                C         D
you know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore.


[Chorus]

G               D
If youll be my bodyguard
C              D    G    D    C D
I can be your long lost pal,
G               D
I can call you Betty,
     C              D
and Betty when you call me
         G          D C D
you can call me Al.


[Verse]

G            D
A man walks down the street,
       C          D
he says why am I short of attention,
G            D
got a short little span of attention,
       C          D
and wo my nights are so long,
G            D
wheres my wife and family,
       C          D
what if I die here,
G            D
wholl be my role-model,
       C          D
now that my role-model is
G            D
gone, gone,
       C          D
he ducked back down the alley
G            D            C          D
with some roly-poly little bat-faced girl,
G            D       
all along, along
               C           D
there were incidents and accidents,

there were hints and allegations.


[Chorus]

G               D
If youll be my bodyguard
C              D    G    D    C D
I can be your long lost pal,
G               D
I can call you Betty,
     C              D
and Betty when you call me
         G    D   C  D
you can call me  Al.
        G   D C D
call me Al.


[Verse]

G            D
A man walks down the street,
       C          D
its a street in a strange world,
G            D
maybe its the Third World,
       C          D
maybe its his first time around,
G            D
he doesnt speak the language,
       C          D
he holds no currency,
G            D
he is a foreign man,
       C          D
he is surrounded by
G            D
the sound, the sound,
       C          D
cattle in the marketplace,
G            D               C          D
scatterlings and orphanages,
G            D      
he looks around, around,
       C          D
he sees angels in the architecture,
G            D      
spinning in infinity,
       C          D
he says Amen and Hallelujah!


[Chorus]

G               D
If youll be my bodyguard
C              D    G    D    C D
I can be your long lost pal,
G               D
I can call you Betty,
     C              D
and Betty when you call me
         G          D C D
you can call me Al.
