[Intro:]
D7 G

[Verse 1:]
              G                   C
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
               D                G
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
                G                     C
But sleep won't come the whole night through
               D                 G
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you


[Chorus:]
                C                 G
When tears come down like fallin' rain
              A7                D
You'll toss around and call my name
                   G            C
You'll walk the floor the way I do
               D7                G
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you


[Interlude:]
G C D (x2)


[Verse 2:]
              G                    C
Your cheatin' heart will pine some day
              D                G
And crave the love you threw away
              G                   C 
The time will come when you'll be blue
              D                 G
Your cheatin heart will tell on you


[Chorus:]
                C                 G
When tears come down like fallin' rain
              A7                D
You'll toss around and call my name
                   G            C
You'll walk the floor the way I do
               D7                G
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
