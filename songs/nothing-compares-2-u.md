[Verse 1]

F                         C
It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Dm                             F  C
since you took your love away
F                        C
I go out every night and sleep all day
Dm                             F  C
since you took your love away
F                                 C
Since you been gone I can do what-ever I want
Dm                           F  C
I can see whomever I choose


[Chorus]

F                              C
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
    Dm                                A
but nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues
     D#         Bb
'cos nothing compares
Dm         C
nothing compares 2 U.


[Verse 2]

F                       C
It's been so lonely without U here
Dm                         F  C
like a bird without a song
F                               C    
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
          Dm                 Bb        
tell me baby where did I go wrong?
F                                C   
I could put my arms around every boy I see
     Dm                      C         
but they only remind me of U.


[Chorus]

F                                         C                             
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me guess what he told me
            Dm                                      A                     
he said: "girl U better try to have fun no matter what U do"
                               
but he's a fool
     D#         Bb   
'cos nothing compares
Dm         C
nothing compares 2U.


[Verse 3]

F                                     C
All the flowers that U planted mama
                     Dm               
in the back yard
                            F       C   
all died when U went away


[Chorus]

F                                   C                                      
I know that living with U baby was sometimes hard
Dm                                A                      
but I'm willing 2 give U another try
     D#         Bb   
'cos nothing compares
Dm         C
nothing compares 2U.
