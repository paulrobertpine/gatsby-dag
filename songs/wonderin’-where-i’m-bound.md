G
It's a long and dusty road**
>      C        /B     Am
It's a hot and heavy load
>       D            /C    /B /A  G
And the folks I meet ain't always kind


**\    G**
**Some are bad and some are good’n**
**\    C        /B         Am      **
**Some have done the best they could**
**\    D             /C      /B /A  G   lick#2**
**Some have tried to ease my trouble in mind**

_**Chorus**_
**\    C             D              G              Em     **
**And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound**
**\    C          D                G**
**can't help but wonder where I'm bound **

**_Verse 2_**
**I've been wandering through this land**
**Just doin' the best I can**
**Trying to find what I was meant to do**
**And the people that I see**
**Look as worried as can be**
**And it looks like they are wand’rin’ too**

_**Verse 3**_
**But I had me a buddy back home**
**And he started off to roam**
**Now he’s out, gone to Frisco Bay**
**And sometimes when I've had a few**
**His old voice comes ringin' through**
**And yes I'm goin' out to see him some old day**

_**Verse 4**_
**If you see me passin' by**
**And you sit and you wonder why**
**And you wish that you were a rambler, too**
**nail your shoes to the kitchen floor**
**Lace'em up and bar the door**
**Thank your stars for the roof that's over you**
