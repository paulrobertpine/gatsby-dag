Capo 2nd fret (sounding A major)

 G    

It's a long and dusty road

\    C        /B     Am

It's a hot and heavy load

\    D            /C    /B /A   G    lick#1

And the folks I meet ain't always kind

\    G

Some are bad and some are good’n

\    C        /B         Am      

Some have done the best they could

\    D             /C      /B /A  G   lick#2

Some have tried to ease my trouble in mind



\    C               D                G                Em      C

And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound

\    D                G

can't help but wonder where I'm bound 



I've been wandering through this land

Just doin' the best I can

Trying to find what I was meant to do

And the people that I see

Look as worried as can be

And it looks like they are wand’rin’ too



But I had me a buddy back home

And he started off to roam

Now he’s out, gone to Frisco Bay

And sometimes when I've had a few

His old voice comes ringin' through

And yes I'm goin' out to see him some old day



If you see me passin' by

And you sit and you wonder why

And you wish that you were a rambler, too

nail your shoes to the kitchen floor

Lace'em up and bar the door

Thank your stars for the roof that's over you
