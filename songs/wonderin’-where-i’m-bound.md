It's a [C]long and dusty road, it's a [F]hot and a [Em]heavy [Dm]load
And the [G7]folks I meet ain't always [C]kind
Some are [C]bad and some are good
Some have [F]done the [Em]best they [Dm]could
Some have [G7]tried to ease my troubled [C]mind

And I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder
Where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound

I've been [C]wanderin' through this land just [F]doin' the [Em]best I [Dm]can
[G]Tryin' to find what I was meant to [C]do
And the [C]people that I see look as [F]worried [Em]as can [Dm]be
And it [G]looks like they are wonderin' [C]too

And I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder
Where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound

Well, I [C]had a little girl one time, she had [F]lips like [Em]sherry [Dm]wine
And she [G]loved me till my head went plumb in-[C]sane
But [C]I was too blind to see she was [F]driftin' a-[Em]way from [Dm]me
And my [G]good gal went off on the morning [C]train

And I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder
Where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound

If you [C]see me passing by and you [F]sit and you [Em]wonder [Dm]why
And you [G]wish that you were rambling [C]too
Nail your [C]shoes to the kitchen floor, lace 'em [F]up and [Em]bar the [Dm]door
Thank your [G]stars for the roof that's over [C]you

And I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder
Where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound
