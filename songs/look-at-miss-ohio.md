[Verse]
F        C      G              Am  G
Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss O-hio
        F                       C       G
She's a-running around with her rag-top down
           F                  C         G
She says I wanna do right but not right now


Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Running around with the rag-top down
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now

[Instrumental break]
Am D7 (x2)

Had your arm around her shoulder, a regimental soldier
An' mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah you wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would ya look at Miss Ohio
She's a-runnin' around with the rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

[Instrumental break]
Am D7 (x2)
F C G Am G
F C G

I know all about it, so you don't have to shout it
I'm gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She a-runnin' around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now
Oh I wanna do right but not right now
