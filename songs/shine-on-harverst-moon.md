[Verse]
Gm                                                                           D7
The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see, cause the moon refused to shine
Gm                                                   C
There’s a couple sittin  ‘neath the willow tree, for love, they pine
Eb                                        Bb
Little May was kinda ‘fraid of darkness, so she said I think I’ll go
C7                                                                           F       
Boy began to sigh, looked up in the sky and told the moon his little tale of woe,
D7/F#
oh

[Chorus]
G7                         C7     
Shine on, shine on harvest moon, up in the sky
F7                         Bb       Eb        Bb
I ain’t had no lovin since January, February, June or July
G7                             C7
Snowtime ain’t no time to stay outdoors and spoon
   F7                         Bb        Eb       Bb
So shine on, shine on harvest moon, for me n’ my gal
