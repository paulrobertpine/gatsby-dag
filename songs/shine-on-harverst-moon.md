[Verse]
Gm                                                                              D7
The night was mighty dark so you could hardly see, cause the moon refused to shine
Gm                                              C
There’s a couple sittin  ‘neath the willow tree, for love, they pine
Eb                                      Bb
Little maid was kinda ‘fraid of darkness, so she said I think I’ll go
C                                                               F       D7
Boy began to sigh, looked up in the sky and told the moon his little tale of woe, oh

[Chorus]
E7                         A7     
Shine on, shine on harvest moon, up in the sky
D7                          G
I ain’t had no lovin since January, February, June or July
E7                              A7
Snowtime ain’t no time to stay outdoors and spoon
   D7                         G         D7        G
So shine on, shine on harvest moon, for me n’ my gal
