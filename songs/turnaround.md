 [C]Bits and [Em]pieces, [Am]you offered [AmG]
 [F]Of your life I [C]didn't think
They [G]meant a lot
Or said much for [C]you

[C]And all the [Em]chances to [Am]follow [AmG]
[F]Didn't make a [C]lot of sense
When [G]stacked against
The [Em]choices you [Am]made [AmG]

CHORUS:
 [F]For yours [G]was the [C]open road.
The [F]bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer was [Am]there. [AmG]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around

[C]Now it's [Em]not like [Am]you made [AmG]out
[F]To hang around, [C] Although you know
[G]I made some sounds
To show that I cared [C]

[C]And when it [Em]looked like you [Am]heard the call [AmG]
[F]I didn't say a lot
[C]Although I could have said
[G]Much more had I [Em]dared [Am] [AmG]

CHORUS:
 [F]For yours [G]was the [C]open road.
The [F]bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer was [Am]there. [AmG] [F]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
 
[C] And [Em]if I had [Am]followed [AmG] 
A [F]little ways
[C]Because were friends
[G]You would have made me
Welcome out [C]there

[C]But we [Em]both know it's [Am]just as well [AmG]
Cause [F]some can go, but
[C]Some are meant
To [G]stay behind
And it's [Em] always that [Am]way [AmG]

CHORUS 2:
 [F]For yours [G]was the [C]open road.
The [F]bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer's still [Am]there. [AmG] [F]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
 
 [F]For yours [G]was the [C]open road.
The [F]bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer's still [Am]there. [AmG] [F]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around

 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
