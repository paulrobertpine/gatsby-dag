 [C]Bits and [Em]pieces, [Am]you offered AmG]
 [F]Of your life I [C]didn't think
They [G]meant a lot
Or said much for [C]you

[C]And all the [Em]chances to [Am]follow [AmG]
[F]Didn't make a [C]lot of sense
When [G]stacked against
The [Em]choices you [Am]made [AmG]

CHORUS:
 [F]For yours [G]was the [C]open road.
The [F]bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer was [Am]there. [AmG] [F]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around

Now it's not like you made out
To hang around
Although you know
I made some sounds
To show that I cared

And when it looked like you heard the call
I didn't say a lot
Although I could have said
Much more had I dared

(CHORUS)
 And if I had followed
A little ways
Because were friends
You would have made me
Welcome out there

But we both know it's just as well
Cause some can go, but
Some are meant
To stay behind
And it's always that way

CHORUS 2:
And yours is the open road.
The bitter song, the heavy load
That I'll never share
Though the offers still there
Every time you turn around

And yours is the open road.
The bitter song, the heavy load
That I'll never share
Though the offers still there

Every time you turn around
Every time you turn around
Every time you turn around
