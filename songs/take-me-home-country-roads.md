G               Em             D                     C          G

Almost Heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.

Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowin 

\    G

like a breeze.

Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong

G                Em                D              C

 All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue

water.

G                Em                  D                         C

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my 

 G

eye.

Country Roads, take me home, to the place I belong

Bridge

Em          D7/F I hear her voice in the morning hours she calls me

\    C       G              D

the radio reminds me of my home far away.

\    Em              F             C             G

And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home 

\    D          D7

yesterday, yesterday.

West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
