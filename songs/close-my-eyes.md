Intro

G
Verse 1
G                      C  G
I'll close my eyes and listen
G/F# Em                 C

to   you, the corn come out.
          Am       Em               C
Don't you hear the stars, they glisten,
   G     D      C     C/B  C/A
as we go in and out.
G                            C  G
Down where the trees grow together,
G/F# Em                 C
and the western path comes to an end
           Am      Em              C
to see the sign it says 'clear weather',
     G          D         C
I'll meet you tonight, my friend.
Chorus
                 G                  C
Will the corn be growing a little tonight,
     G                      D
as I wait in the fields for you?
    C          D            Em      C
Who knows what grows in the morning light
            G        D      G
when we can feel the watery dew?
Verse 2
G                             C G
I just can't be there with no other,
G/F# Em                 C
I    know those hills will be true,
 Am          Em            C
away from my sister and brother,
    G                D          C
and down through the grasses so blue.
G                    C   G
The air is sweet and steady
G/F# Em                 C
and  flowers bloom out of sight,
  Am       Em         C
I know the sky is ready,
    G             D      C
come meet me down here tonight.
Chorus
                 G                  C
Will the corn be growing a little tonight,
     G                      D
as I wait in the fields for you?
    C          D            Em      C
Who knows what grows in the morning light
            G        D      G       C  G
when we can feel the watery dew?
