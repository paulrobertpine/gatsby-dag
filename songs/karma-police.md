[Verse]
Am  D/F#    Em
Kar-ma     Police,
  G             Am
arrest this man,
   F    Em
he talks in maths,
   G                 Am
he buzzes like a fridge
     D  G         C   C/B  Am   Bm   D
he's like a detuned ra-di -  o 

Am  D/F# Em
Kar-ma    Police,
  G             Am
arrest this girl,
    F     Em
her hitler hairdo,
   G                    Am
is making me feel ill,
    D         G                 C   C/B  Am   Bm   D
and we have crashed her par-ty

This is what you'll get,
C       D           G   F#
This is what you'll get,
C       D           G
This is what you'll get,
         Bm        C    Bm  D
When you mess with us...

[Verse]
Am  D/F#   Em
Kar-ma    Police,
     G       Am
I've given all I can,
     F    Em
it's not   enough,
     G       Am
I've given all I can,
    D             G      C C/B Am   Bm   D
but we're still on the pay   roll.

[Chorus]
C       D           G   F#
This is what you'll get,
C       D           G   F#
This is what you'll get,
C       D           G
This is what you'll get,
         Bm        C    Bm  D
When you mess with us...

[Bridge]
Bm        D          G
And for a minute there,
  D      G      D      E7
I lost myself I lost myself,
Bm          D        G
And for a minute there,
  D      G      D      E7
I lost myself I lost myself,

Bm        D          G
And for a minute there,
  D      G      D      E7
I lost myself I lost myself,
Bm          D        G
Just for a minute there,
  D      G      D      E7
I lost myself I lost myself
