G           D             Em          C
The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top,
G           D      G        D
The snow is softly falling.
G          D                Em            C
The air is still within the silence of my room,
G           D            G
I hear your voice softly calling.

           D    C        D
If I could only have you near,
Bm           Em      Am  D
To breathe a sigh or two,
G          D             Em               C
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love..
G       D                   G   D
on this winter's night with you.

The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead,
My glass is almost empty.
I read again between the lines upon the page,
The words of love you sent me.

If I could know within my heart
That you were lonely too
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
Upon this winter night with you.

The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim
The shades of night are lifting
The mornin' light steals across my windowpane
Where webs of snow are drifting.
If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
G         D               B7 Em
And to be once again with you.
C         D                    G
and to be once again with with you.
