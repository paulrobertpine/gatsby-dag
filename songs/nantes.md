[Intro]  
Am G C
Am G C


[Verse]
                  Am         G         C
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
           Am       G C
Since I've seen you smile
         Am      G      C
And I'll gamble away my fright
         Am      G      C
And I'll gamble away my time
         Am      G       C
And in a year, a year or so
          Am     G      C
This will slip into the sea
                Am         G         C
But it's been a long time, long time now
           Am       G C
Since I've seen you smile


[Instrumental]

Am G C


[Chorus]
Am        G          C
   Nobody raise your voices, o-o-o-oh
Am              G        C
   Just another night in Nantes
Am        G          C
   Nobody raise your voices, o-o-o-oh
Am              G        C
   Just another night in Nantes


[Instrumental]

[Verse]
                  Am         G         C
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
           Am       G C
Since I've seen you smile
         Am      G      C
And I'll gamble away my fright
         Am      G      C
And I'll gamble away my time
         Am      G       C
And in a year, a year or so
          Am     G      C
This will slip into the sea
                Am         G         C
But it's been a long time, long time now
           Am       G C
Since I've seen you smile
