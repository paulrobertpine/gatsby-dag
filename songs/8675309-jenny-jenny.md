(Verse)
Jenny Jenny, who can I turn to?
You give me something I can hold onto
I know you think I'm like the others before
Who saw your name and number on the wall

(Chorus)
[E]Jenny I got your number
[E]I need to [A]make you [D]mine
[E]Jenny don't [A]change your [D]number

[|F#m.D.|A.B.|]
867-5309 (867-5309)
867-5309 (867-5309)

[|F#m.D.|A.B.|]
Jenny Jenny, your the girl for me
You don't know me but you make me so happy
I tried to call you before but I lost my nerve
I tried my imagination but I was disturbed

[E]Jenny I got your number
[E]I need to [A]make you [D]mine
[E]Jenny don't [A]change your [D]number

[|F#m.D.|A.B.|]
867-5309 (867-5309)
867-5309 (867-5309)

(Bridge)
[C#m]I got it [E](I got it) I got it
[F#m] I got your [A]number on the [B]wall
[C#m]I got it [E](I got it) I got it
[F#m]For a good time, for a [A]good time [B]call!

(Solo)
[|F#m.D.|A.B.|]

[Chorus]
[E]Jenny I got your number
[E]I need to [A]make you [D]mine
[E]Jenny don't [A]change your [D]number

[|F#m.D.|A.B.|]
867-5309 (867-5309)
867-5309 (867-5309)

Jenny Jenny, Who can I turn too
(867-5309)
For the price of a dime I can always turn to you
(867-5309)
867-5309 (867-5309)
867-5309 (867-5309)
