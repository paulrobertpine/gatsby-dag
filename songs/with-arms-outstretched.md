[E]

It's sixteen miles to the [F#m]promised land
And I [A]promise you I'm [B]doing the best I[E]can
Now don't [E]fool yourself
In thinking you're[F#m]more than a man
Cause you'll [A]probably [B]end up dead[E]

I [E]visit these
Mountains[F#m]with frequency
And I [A]stand here with my [B]arms up[E]

Now [F#m]somedays they'll [B]last longer than [E]others
But [F#m]this day by the [B]lake went too [E]fast

And if you [A]want me
You [B]better speak up [C#m]I won't [E]wait
So you [A]better [B]move fast[E]

Don't [E]fool yourself
In thinking you're [F#m]more than you are
With your [A]arms outstretched to [B]me[E]

Now its [E]16 miles to the [F#m]promised land
And I [A]promise you I'm [B]doing the best I[E]can

Now [F#m]somedays they'll [B]last longer than [E]others
But [F#m]this day by the [B]lake went too [E]fast

And if you [A]want me
You [B]better speak up [C#m]I won't [E]wait
So you [A]better [B]move fast[E]

Now [F#m]somedays they'll [B]last longer than [E]others
But [F#m]this day by the [B]lake went too [E]fast

And if you [A]want me
You [B]better speak up [C#m]I won't [E]wait
So you [A]better [B]move fast[E]
