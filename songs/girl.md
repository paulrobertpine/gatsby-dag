[Verse]

       Em        B7                Em  Em7
is there anybody going to listen to my story
Am             C6              G      B7
all about the girl who came to stay?
       Em       B7                          Em         Em7
she's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Am                C6             Em
still you don't regret a single day


[Chorus]

   G    Bm    Am  D7
ah girl      
   G    Bm    Am D7
ah girl      


[Verse]

       Em                B7                  Em      Em7
when i think of all the times i've tried so hard to leave her
Am              C6               G     B7 
she will come to me and start to cry
        Em             B7              Em  Em7
and she promises the earth to me and i bel-ieve her
Am              C6               Em
after all this time i don't know why


[Chorus]

G    Bm    Am  D7
ah girl      
   G    Bm    Am D7
ah girl      


[Bridge]

Am                                  E
she's the kind of girl who puts you down
                                    Am   E
when friends are there, you feel a fool
Am                              
when you say she's looking good
     E                                 Am         C
she acts as if it's understood, she's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


[Chorus]

G    Bm    Am  D7
ah girl      
   G    Bm    Am D7
ah girl      


[Verse]

        Em                B7                    Em       Em7
was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Am                               G    B7
did she understand it when they said
       Em                 B7               Em     Em7
that a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure,
Am                                   Em
will she still believe it when he's dead?


[Chorus]

G    Bm    Am  D7
ah girl      
   G    Bm    Am D7
ah girl
