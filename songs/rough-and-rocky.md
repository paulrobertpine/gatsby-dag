G              C       G
Darling, I have come to tell you
                           D
Though it almost breaks my heart
G              C        G
But before the morning, darling
D                   G
We'll be many miles apart

[chorus]
C                              G
Don't this road look rough and rocky
                             D
Don't that sea look wide and deep
G             C        G
Don't my baby look the sweetest
D                     G
when she's in my arms asleep


Can't you hear the nightbirds crying
Far across the deep blue sea
While the others you are thinking
Won't you sometimes think of me

[chorus]

One more kiss before i leave you
One more kiss before we part
You have caused me lots of trouble
darling, you have broke my heart

[chorus]
