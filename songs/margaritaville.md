[Intro]
D G A D

[Verse]
D
   Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake
                                   A
All of those tourists covered with oil
A
   Strummin' my six string, on my front porch swing
                                       D     D7
Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil

[Chorus]
G           A                  D        D7   G                 A                D     D7
   Wastin' away again in Margaritaville,        searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
G              A                    D   A/C#  G           A                   D
   Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, but I know, it's nobody's fault

[Verse]
D
   Don't know the reason, I stayed here all season
                                      A
Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
A
   But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie
                            D     D7
How it got here I haven't a clue

[Chorus]
G           A                  D        D7   G                 A                D     D7
   Wastin' away again in Margaritaville,        searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
G              A                    D   A/C#  G           A                          D
   Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, now I think, hell it could be my fault

[Instrumental]
D     A 
G A D A/C# G A D

[Verse]
D
   I blew out my flip flop, stepped on a pop top
                                  A
Cut my heal had to cruise on back home
A
   But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render
                                        D     D7
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

[Chorus]
G           A                  D        D7   G                 A                D     D7
   Wastin' away again in Margaritaville,        searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
G              A                    D   A/C#   G          A                      D    D7
   Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, but I know, it's my own damn fault
         G             A                    D   A/C#  G           A                      D
Yes and,   some people claim that there's a woman to blame, and I know, it's my own damn fault
