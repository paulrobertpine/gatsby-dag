[Am]Well no one [D]told me a[Am7]bout [D]her[Am], the [F]way she [Am]lied[D]
[Am]Well no one [D]told me a[Am7]bout [D]her[Am], how many [F]people [A]cried

But it's too [D]late to [Dm]say you're [Am]sorry
How would I [Em]know, why should I [Am]care?
Please don't [D]bother [Dm]tryin' to [C]find her
She's not [E7]there

Well let me tell you 'bout the [Am]way she [D]looked
The way she'd [Am]acted and the [F]color of her [Am]hair[D]
Her voice was [Am]soft and [F]cool
Her eyes were [Am]clear and [D]bright
But she's not [A]there

[Am]Well no one [D]told me a[Am7]bout [D]her[Am], what [F]could I [Am]do[D]
[Am]Well no one [D]told me a[Am7]bout [D]her[Am], though [F]they all [A]knew

But it's too [D]late to [Dm]say you're [Am]sorry
How would I [Em]know why should I [Am]care?
Please don't [D]bother [Dm]tryin' to [C]find her
She's not [E7]there

Well let me tell you 'bout the [Am]way she [D]looked
The way she'd [Am]acted and the [F]color of her [Am]hair[D]
Her voice was [Am]soft and [F]cool
Her eyes were [Am]clear and [D]bright
But she's not [A]there
