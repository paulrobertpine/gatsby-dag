|A C# |F# B |A C# |F# B |
One baby to another says I'm lucky to have met you...
A C# F# B A C# F# 
I don't care what you think unless it is about me

It is now my duty to completely drain you 

I travel through a tube and end up in your infection 


E 

D B 
Chew your meat for you. 

D B
Pass it back and forth 

In a passionate kiss

From my mouth to yours,

A G     F# 
I like you...

[Verse 2]

A C# F# B A C# F# B
With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
A C# F# B A C# F# 
You've taught me everything Without a poison apple

The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student 

Indebted and so grateful - Vacuum out the fluids 

[Chorus]

E 
D B 
Chew your meat for you. 

D B
Pass it back and forth 

In a passionate kiss

From my mouth to yours,

A G    F#
I like you...
