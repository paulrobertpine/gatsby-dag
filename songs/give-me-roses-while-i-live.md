[G]Wonderful things of folks are said
[D7]When they have passed [G]away                      
Roses adorn the narrow bed
[D7]Over the sleeping [G]clay

chorus
[C]Give me the roses [G]while I live 
Trying to cheer me [D7]on
[G]Useless are flowers that you give 
[D7]After the soul is [G]gone

(play chorus instrumental after each chorus)

Let us not wait to do good deeds
Till they have passed away
Now is the time to sow good seeds
While here on earth we stay

(chorus)

Let us not wait to do good deeds
Till they have passed away
Now is the time to sow good seeds
While here on earth we stay

(chorus x2)
