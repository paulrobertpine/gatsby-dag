Verse

\    Em          D

I was lost in the lakes

\    A                C

And the shapes that your body makes

\    Em                    D

That your body makes, that your body makes

\    A             C

That your body makes

Instrumental

Verse

\    Em                     D

The mountains said I could find you here

\    A                          C

They whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear

   Em               D

I traced my finger along your trails

\    A                  C

Your body was the map, I was lost in it

Chorus

G                  D

Floating over your rocky spine

\    A                      C         D

The glaciers made you, and now you’re mine

G                  D

Floating over your rocky spine

\    A                      C         D

The glaciers made you, and now you’re mine

Instrumental

Verse

\    Em                 D

I was moving across your frozen veneer

\    A                C

The sky was dark but you were clear

Em                D

Could you feel my footsteps

\    A                            C

And would you shatter, would you shatter, would you

Instrumental

Verse

\    Em             D

And with your soft fingers between my claws

\    A       C

Like purity against resolve

\    Em                                 D

I could tell, then and there, that we were formed from the clay

\    A                           C   D

And came from the rocks for the earth to display

\    G            D

They told me to be careful up there

\    A                     C   D

Where the wind blows a venomous rage through your hair

\    G            D

They told me to be careful up there

\    A                       C   D

Where the wind rages through your hair
