Gm F Gm D#

Gm F C D#

\    Gm          F

I was lost in the lakes

\    C                D#

And the shapes that your body makes

\    Gm                    F

That your body makes, that your body makes

\    C             D#

That your body makes

F D# 

F D#

\    Gm                     F

The mountains said I could find you here

\    C                          D#

They whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear

   Gm               F

I traced my finger along your trails

\    C                  D#

Your body was the map, I was lost in it

\[Chorus]

A#                 F

Floating over your rocky spine

\    C                      D#        F

The glaciers made you, and now you’re mine

A#                 F

Floating over your rocky spine

\    C                      D#        F

The glaciers made you, and now you’re mine

Gm F C D#

Gm F C D#

\    Gm                 F

I was moving across your frozen veneer

\    C                D#

The sky was dark but you were clear

Gm                F

Could you feel my footsteps

\    C                            D#

And would you shatter, would you shatter, would you

F D# F D#

\[Verse]

\    Gm             F

And with your soft fingers between my claws

\    C       D#

Like purity against resolve

\    Gm                                 F

I could tell, then and there, that we were formed from the clay

\    C                           D#  F

And came from the rocks for the earth to display

\    A#           F

They told me to be careful up there

\    C                     D#  F

Where the wind blows a venomous rage through your hair

\    A#           F

They told me to be careful up there

\    C                       D#  F

Where the wind rages through your hair

Gm F C D#

Gm F C D#
