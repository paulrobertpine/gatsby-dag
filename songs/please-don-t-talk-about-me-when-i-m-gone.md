             (Capo 2nd fret.)
G                 B7                E
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
           A                     D                G
Oh, honey, though our friendship ceases, from now on.
D           G                B7            E
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice.
            A               D            G
It's better not to talk, at all, is my advice.
CHORUS:
               B7
We're parting..you go your way, I'll go mine.
          E
It's best that we do.
A                A7                     D               D7
Here's a kiss, I hope that this, brings lots of luck to you.
    G                   B7          E
Oh, makes no difference how I carry on.
          A                  D                G
Remember, please don't talk about me when I'm gone.
