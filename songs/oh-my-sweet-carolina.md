I went down to Houston and I stopped in San Antone
    C                            G
I passed up the station for the bus
    F                  C               Am               F
Was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what

Bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
   F            C             Am               F
I was spendin' money like the way it likes to rain

I ain't never been to Vegas but I gambled up my life
    C                                      G
Building newsprint boats I raced to sewer mains

I miss Kentucky and I miss my family
