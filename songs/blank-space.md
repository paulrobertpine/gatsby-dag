[Verse]

D
 Nice to meet you where you been
                          Bm
I can show you incredible things

Magic, madness, heaven sin

Saw you there and I thought
G
Oh my God, look at that face

You look like my next mistake
A7sus4                    A
Loveâ€™s a game, want to plaaaaay?

D
 New money, suit and tie
                          Bm
I can read you like a magazine

Ain't it funny rumors fly

And I know you heard about  
G
Me so hey, lets be friends

I'm dying to see how this one ends
A
Grab your passport and my hand
G                       A
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend


[Chorus]

D                                                        Bm
 So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over mmm
                              Em
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
                           G
They'll tell you I'm insane
                                                       D
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game

D
Cause we're young and we're reckless
                           Bm
We'll take this way too far

 It'll leave you breathless, mmm
                    Em
Or with a nasty scar

 Got a long list of ex-lovers
                           G
They'll tell you I'm insane  
                          G   N.C.                D
But I got a blank space baby and I'll write your name


[Verse]

D
Cherry lips, crystal skies
                            Bm
I could show you incredible things

Stolen kisses, pretty lies
                              G
You're the king baby I'm your queen

Find out what you want       
           
Be that girl for a month
A7sus4                     A        
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no

 D                         
Screaming crying perfect storms
                          Bm
I can make all the tables turn

Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessing
      G
Like "Oh my god who is she?"

I get drunk on jealousy
    A
But you'll come back each time you leave
                               G N.C.
Cause darlin' I'm a nightmare, dressed like a daydream


[Chorus]

D                                                        Bm
 So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over, mm
                              Em
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
                           G
They'll tell you I'm insane
                                                       D
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game

 D
Cause we're young and we're reckless
                           Bm
We'll take this way too far

It'll leave you breathless, mmm
                    Em
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
                           G
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
                          G  N.C.
But I got a blank space baby and I'll write your name


[Bridge]

D           
 Boys only want love if it's torture

Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you
D  
 Boys only want love if it's torture
D N.C.
 Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you


[Chorus]

D                                                        Bm
 So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over mmm
                              Em
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
                           G
They'll tell you I'm insane
                                                       D
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game


Cause we're young and we're reckless
                           Bm
We'll take this way too far

It'll leave you breathless, mmm
                    Em
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
                           G
They'll tell you I'm insane  
                          G  N.C.
But I got a blank space baby and I'll write your name
