D
Nice to meet you where you been
                          Bm
I can show you incredible things

Magic, madness, heaven sin

Saw you there and I thought
G
Oh my God, look at that face

You look like my next mistake
A7sus4                 A
Loveâ€™s a game, want to plaaaaay?

D
New money, suit and tie
                          Bm
I can read you like a magazine

Ain't it funny rumors fly

And I know you heard about
G
Me so hey, lets be friends

I'm dying to see how this one ends
A
Grab your passport and my hand
G                       A
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend


D
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
Bm
You can tell me when it's over mmm

If the high was worth the pain
Em
Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane
G
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game

(chorus)
D
Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far
Bm
It'll leave you breathles

Or with a nasty scar
Em
Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane
G
But I got a blank space baby and I'll write your name

D
Cherry lips, crystal skies

I could show you incredible things
Bm
Stolen kisses, pretty lies

You're the king baby I'm your queen
G
Find out what you want

Be that girl for a month
A7sus4                     A
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no

D
Screaming crying perfect storms

I can make all the tables turn
Bm
Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessing
      G
Like "Oh my god who is she?"

I get drunk on jealousy
    A
But you'll come back each time you leave
                               G
Cause darlin' I'm a nightmare, dressed like a daydream

D                                                        Bm
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames

You can tell me when it's over, mm
                              Em
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
                           G
They'll tell you I'm insane
                                                       D
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game

(chorus)


(bridge)
D
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you

(chorus)
D
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
Bm
You can tell me when it's over mmm

If the high was worth the pain
Em
Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane
G
Cause you know I love the players and you love the game

D
Cause we're young and we're reckless

We'll take this way too far
Bm
It'll leave you breathless, mmm

Or with a nasty scar
Em
Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane
G
But I got a blank space baby and I'll write your name
D
