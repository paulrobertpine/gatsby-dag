C                                         F
Standing on the corner with a nickel or a dime
F                 C                      C/B    Am
There use to be a rail car to take you down the line
C                                      F
Too much beer and whiskey to ever be employed
F                 C                             C/B   Am
And when I got to Nashville, it was too much soldiers joy
C                                    F  
Wasted on the wayside, wasted on the way
F               C                    C/B  Am
If I don’t go tomorrow, you know I’m gone today

C                  F
Back babe, back in time
           C                  Am
I wanna go back when you were mine
C                  F
Back babe, back in time
           Am  G              C
I wanna go back when you were mine

Em                      F
Black highway all night ride
             Am       G             F
Watching the times fall away to the side
Em                     F   
Clear channel way down low
             Am   G               F  
Is comin’ in loud and my mind let go

C                                        F
Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall
F                   C                          C/B     Am
If I can’t have you all the time, I won’t have none at all
C                                                 F
Oh, I wish I was in Frisco in a brand new pair of shoes
F                   C                        C/B      Am
I’m sittin’ here in Nashville with Norman’s Nashville blues
        C                                          F
So come all you good time rounders listenin’ to my sound
F                           C                 C/B       Am
And then drink a round to Nashville before they tear it down

C                  F
Back babe, back in time
           C                  Am
I wanna go back when you were mine
C                  F
Back babe, back in time
           Am     G           C
I wanna go back when you were mine

Em                    F
Hard weather, drivin’ slow
                Am   G               F
Buggies and the hats in town for the show
Em                        F
Oh darlin, the songs they played
          Am  G          F
All I got left of lovin’ me

C                  F
Back babe, back in time
           C                  Am
I wanna go back when you were mine
C                  F
Back babe, back in time
            Am  G             C   
I wanna go back when you were mine
