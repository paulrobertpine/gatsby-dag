[Intro]

E D C E


[Verse]

                   E
If i had to lose a mile
                  D
If i had to touch feelings
                  C
I would lose my soul
    D     E
The way i do

                      E   
Well i dont have to think
               D
I only have to do it
                       C
The results are always perfect
    D           E
And that's old news

                          E
Would you like to hear my voice
                 D
Sprinkled with emotion
C                    E
  Invented your birth


[Chorus]

G            E
Well i can't see
G          E
The end of me
G        E
My whole expance
G         E
I can not see
              C       D     
I formulate infinite  
                    E
And store it deep inside of me
