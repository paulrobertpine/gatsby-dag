[Am]

You [Am]walked into the party;
like you were[F] walking on to a [Am]yacht
Your [Am]hat, strategically dipped below one eye;
your [F]scarf it was apric[Am]ot
You had [F]one eye [G]in the [Em]mirror [Am]as   you w[F]atched yourself ga[C]votte
And all the [G]girls dreamed that t[F]hey’d be your partner, they'd be your partner and

[C]You're so vain,
[Dm]you prob'ly think this song is ab[C]out you
[C]You're so v[Am]ain,
[F]I’ll bet you think this song is ab[G]out you, don't you, don't you

You [Am]had me several years ago;
when I[F] was still quite na[Am]ive
Well, you s[Am]aid that we make such a pretty pair
and t[F]hat you would never l[Am]eave
But you g[F]ave aw[G]ay the [Em]things you [Am]loved and [F]one of them was [C]me
I had some [G]dreams; they were [F]clouds in my coffee, clouds in my coffee and

[C]You're so vain,
[Dm]you prob'ly think this song is ab[C]out you
[C]You're so v[Am]ain,
[F]I’ll bet you think this song is ab[G]out you, don't you, don't you, don't you

[Am][F][Am][Am][F][Am][F][G][Em][Am][F][C]

[F]I had some dreams; they were [G]clouds in my coffee, clouds in my coffee and

[C]You're so vain,
[Dm]you prob'ly think this song is ab[C]out you
[C]You're so v[Am]ain,
[F]I’ll bet you think this song is ab[G]out you, don't you, don't you

Well, I [Am]hear you went up to Saratoga and your [F]horse naturally [Am]won
Then you [Am]flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia
To see the [F]total eclipse of the [Am]sun
Well you're [F]where you [G]should be [Em]all the t[Am]ime
and [F]when you're not you're [C]with
Some under world [G]spy, or the [F]wife of a close friend, wife of a close friend and

[C]You're so vain,
[Dm]you prob'ly think this song is ab[C]out you
[C]You're so v[Am]ain,
[F]I’ll bet you think this song is ab[G]out you, don't you, don't you, don't you now

[C][Dm][C]

[C]You're so vain, you [Dm]prob'ly think this song is [C]about you
[C]You're so vain, you [Dm]prob'ly think this song is [C]about you....
