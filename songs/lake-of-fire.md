Chorus
Em                   D            G
 Where do bad folks go when they die
      Em                          A          G  
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Em               D        G
Go to a lake of fire and fry
 A                        D         Em
See them again 'till the fourth of July

Verse 1
Bm                 G
I knew a lady who came from Duluth
Bm                      F#
Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
    Bm                        G
She went to her grave just a little too soon
  A                              Bm
Flew and lay down on the yellow moon
Chorus
Em                   D            G
 Where do bad folks go when they die
      Em                          A          G  
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Em               D        G
Go to a lake of fire and fry
 A                        D         Em
See them again 'till the fourth of July

Verse 2
Bm              G
People cry and people moan
 Bm                      F#
Look for a dry place to call their home
Bm                         G
Try to find some place to rest their bones
          A                            Bm
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own
Chorus

They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Em               D        G
Go to a lake of fire and fry
 A                        D         Em
See them again 'till the fourth of July
