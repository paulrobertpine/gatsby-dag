[G]Where do bad folks [F]go when they [Bb]die?
[G]They dont go to heaven where the a[C]ngels f[Bb]ly
[G]They go to a lake out of [F]fire and [Bb]fry
[C]Wont see them again till the f[F]ourth of[Bb] Ju[G]ly

[Dm]I knew a lady who [Bb*]came from Duluth
[Dm]She got bitten by a dog with[A]a rabid tooth
[Dm]She went to her grave just a [Bb*]little too soon
[C*]And flew away howling on the yell[Dm*]ow moon

[G]Where do bad folks [F]go when they [Bb]die?
[G]They dont go to heaven where the [C]angels [Bb]fly
[G]They go to a lake out of [F]fire and[Bb]fry
[C]Wont see them again till the f[F]ourth of[Bb] Ju[G]ly

[Dm]Now the people cry and the [Bb*]people moan
[Dm]They look for a dry place to c[A]all their home
[Dm]And try to find some place to [Bb*]rest their bones
[C*]While the angels and the devils t[Dm*]ry to make them their own

[G]Where do bad folks [F]go when they [Bb]die?
[G]They dont go to heaven where the a[C]ngels f[Bb]ly
[G]They go to a lake out of [F]fire and [Bb]fry
[C]Wont see them again till the f[F]ourth of[Bb] Ju[G]ly
