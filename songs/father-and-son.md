         G              D/F
It's not time to make a change, just relax and take it easy
             G                 Em                Am               D
You're still young that's your fault, there's so much you have to know

        G        Em           Am     D
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
      G                 D          C                  Am7
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
      G                Em                    Am    D
To be calm when you've found something going on
              G             D                 C                 Am7
But take your time, think a lot, why think of everything you've got
             G               Em               D          G
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not

Verse 2 - Son
        G          Bm                   C            Am7
How can I try to explain? 'cause when I do he turns away again
     G               Em             Am     D
It's always been the same, same old story
         G              Bm         C          Am7
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
              G          Em          D       G
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away
  D      C       G
I know I have to go

It's not time to make a change, just sit down and take it slowly

Verse 4 - Son
        G               Bm             C                Am7
All the times that I've cried, keeping all the things I knew inside
     G              Em         Am       D
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it
             G           Bm             C                   Am7
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know, not me

I know I have to go
