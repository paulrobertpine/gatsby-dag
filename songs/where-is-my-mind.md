           E                        C#m               G#  A
 With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
E    C#m            G#       A         
 Try this trick and spin it, yeah
E                  C#m
 Your head will collapse
            G#
But there's nothing in it
           A
And you'll ask yourself

E            C#m
 Where is my mind?
G#           A

 Where is my mind?
 E   G#         A             Am        C#m   B
 Way out in the water, see it swimming.


E                        C#m    G#  A
I was swimmin' in the Carribean
E             C#m                  G#  A
   Animals were hiding behind the rock
E                    C#m                  
   Except the little fish
          G#
But they told me, he swears
           A
Tryin' to talk to me, to me, to me


E            C#m
 Where is my mind?
G#           A
 Where is my mind?  
     E       C#m   G#  A    E  C#m  G#  A
