\[Verse & choruses]

F     Am  G                F   Am  G

Today        you were far away 

\    F Am  G                  C   G

And I         didn't ask you why

\    F  Am  G

What could I say

\    F   Am  G

I was far away

\    F    Am  G

You just walked away

\    F  Am  G

and I just watched you

\    C   G

What could I say

\    F  Am  G             F  Am  G

How close am I        to losing you

\    F   Am  G                       F    Am  G

Tonight        you just close your eyes       

\    F  Am  G        C   G

And I just watch you        slip away

\    F  Am  G              F  Am  G  F  Am  G

How close am I         to losing you

Hey,   are you awake,    yeah I'm right here

\    F       Am  G          C    G

Well can I ask you        about today

\    F  Am  G              F  Am  G

How close am I        to losing you

\    F  Am  G

How close am I        to losing
