[Intro] 

D Bb C (4 times)


[Verse]

D      Bb      C      D
Sucker love is heaven sent
           Bb      C         D
You pucker up, our passion's spent
            Bb         C      D
My hearts a tart, your body's rent
          Bb      C        Bb
My body's broken, yours is spent


[Chorus]

Bb                      D
Carve your name into my arm
                                Bb
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed
                            F
Cuz there's nothing else to do
      A            D
Every me and every you


[Verse]

       Bb      C     D
Sucker love, a box I choose
         Bb    C         D
No other box I choose to use
        Bb     C     D
Another love I would abuse
         Bb      C     Bb
No circumstances could excuse


[Chorus]

                          D
In the shape of things to come
                       Bb
Too much poison come undone
                            F
Cuz there's nothing else to do
      A            Bb
Every me and every you
                   F
Every me and every you
      A    D
Every Me...hee


[Verse]

       Bb      C        D
Sucker love is known to swing
         Bb        C           D
Prone to cling and waste these things
       Bb     C       D      
Pucker up for heavens sake
              Bb      C       Bb
There's never been so much at stake


[Chorus]

                        D
I serve my head up on a plate
                           Bb
It's only comfort, calling late
                            F
Cuz there's nothing else to do
      A            Bb
Every me and every you
                   F
Every me and every you
      A    Bb
Every Me...hee

                   F
Every me and every you
      A    D
Every Me...hee


[Verse]

         Bb    C         D
Like the naked leads the blind
           Bb       C     D
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind
       Bb     C      D
Sucker love I always find
           Bb         C       Bb
Someone to bruise and leave behind


[Chorus]

                       D
All alone in space and time
                                            Bb
There's nothing here but what here's here's mine
                              F
Something borrowed, something blue
      A            Bb
Every me and every you
                   F
Every me and every you
      A    Bb
Every Me...hee
                   F
Every me and every you
      A    Bb
Every Me...hee (4 times)
