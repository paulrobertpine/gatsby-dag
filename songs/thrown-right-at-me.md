C                    C/G
Jump 'long the creekside
F                   C
The rock's crooked line
FFun curls your hair and
F                C
The days open wide
C                  F             G7          C
And horses trot faster 'til sparrows fall down
   FBut you just fall, laughin', to the snow on the ground
F             G7           C           F
You grew up by playin' the valley so wild
           Em     (7)
And that's why
G*                    C
You're so beautiful now

And, dancin' you back to the lonesome, young mare
You call up her owner; say your heart will be there
You'll build a collection of scars on your knees
To learn how to count the impossible trees
You grew up by climbin' the birches so high
And that's why
You're so beautiful now
And we live so close that we probably seen
The same bird, the same time
They solumnly scream
One day, I'll find just that friend who can see
All this weird beauty
Thrown right at me
Growin' by playin' the valley so wild
And that's why
You're so beautiful now
