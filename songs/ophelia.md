[Intro]

G C7

[Verse]

C E7
Boards on the window, mail by the door,
A7 D7
What would anybody leave so quickly for?
F G7 C A7 D7 G7
Ophelia, where have you gone?
C E7
The old neighborhood, just ain't the same

A7 D7
Nobody knows just what became of..
F G7 C C7 D7 E7
Ophelia, tell me, what went wrong?

[Chorus]

F C
Was it something that somebody said?
G7 C
Mama, I know we broke the rules.
F C
Was somebody up against the law?
G7 G7#5
Honey, you know I'd die for you.

[Verse]

C E7
Ashes of laughter, the ghost is clear,
A7 D7
Why do the best things always disappear, like
F G7 C A7 D7 G7
Ophelia? Please darken my door.
