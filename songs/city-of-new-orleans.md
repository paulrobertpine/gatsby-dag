[Verse]

C              G           C
Riding on the City of New Orleans
Am                F               C
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail
          C               G                C
There's fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
          Am          G                    C
Three conductors and twenty five sacks of mail
     Am                                 Em
All along the south bound odyssey, the train pulls in from Kankikee
G                                    D
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Am
Passing towns that have no names
     Em
And freight yards full of old black men
          G                 G7          C
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles


[Chorus]

F             G          C
Good morning America, how are you?
        Am                 F               C
I said don't you know me, I’m your native son
G         C                  G           Am
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
         Eb        F       G              G7     C
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

[Verse]

C                       G              C
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car
   Am                        F               C
A penny a point, there ain't no one keeping score
C               G                  C
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
      Am                 G                     C
I can feel the wheels a-grumbling 'neath the floor
         Am
And the sons of Pullman porters
         Em
And the sons of engineers
            G                            D
Ride their fathers magic carpet made of steel
         Am
And the mothers with their babes asleep
    Em
Go rocking to the gentle beat
         G             G7                C
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel


[Chorus]

F              G          C
Good morning America, how are you?
       Am                 F               C
I said don't you know me, I’m your native son
G       C                   G           Am
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
        Eb        F       G              G7     C
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

C                  G           C
Night time on the City of New Orleans
       Am                 F             C
We're changing cars for Memphis, Tennessee
       C                G                 C
We're halfway home and we'll be there by morning
             Am                    G                 C
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
    Am
And all the towns and people seem
    Em
To fade into a bad dream
         G                                D
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
     Am
The conductor sings his songs again
    Em
The passengers will please refrain
      G                    G7                C
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues


[Chorus]

F            G           C
Good Night America, how are you
        Am                 F               C
I said don't you know me, I’m your native son
G       C                   G           Am
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
        Eb        F       G              G7     C
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
     F        G          C
Good Night America, how are you
       Am                 F               C
I said don't you know me, I’m your native son
G       C                   G           Am
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
        Eb        F       G              G7     C
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

2 3 4 1 2 3
        Eb        F       G              G7     C
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
