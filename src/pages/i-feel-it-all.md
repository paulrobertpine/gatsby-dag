[Verse 1]
D                   G           G     Bm
 I feel it all, I feel it all
D                   G           G     Bm
 I feel it all, I feel it all
D                           G            G    Bm
   The wings are wide, the wings are wide
D                        G                G   Bm
   Wild card inside,    wild card inside

[Hook]
F#              G                   Em                  A              
Oh I’ll be the one who'll break my heart  I'll be the one to hold the gun

[Verse 2]
D                      G         G   Bm
   I know more than I knew before
D                       G        G   Bm
   I know more than I knew before
D                      G        G     Bm
   I didn't rest, I didn't stop
D                   G          G     Bm
   Did we fight or did we talk

[Hook]
F#              G                   Em                  A    
Oh I’ll be the one who'll break my heart  I'll be the one to hold the gun

[Verse 3]
D                     G      G       Bm
I love you more
D                 G       G       Bm
I love you more
D                     G        G        Bm
I don't know what I knew before
D                         G          G     Bm
But now I know I want to win the war

[Bridge]
G                            Em
No one likes to take a test, Sometimes you know more is less
G                                    A
Put your weight against the door, Kick drum on the basement floor
G                             A
Stranded in a fog of words, Loved him like a winter bird
G                             Em
On my head the water pours, Gulf stream through the open door





[Verse 4]

F#m        G                    A           (stop playing)
Fly away Fly away to what you want to make  Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh OH!
D                   G         G   Bm
I feel it all    I feel it all
D                   G         G   Bm
I feel it all    I feel it all
D                          G           G  Bm
The wings are wide   The wings are wide
D                         G             G   Bm
Wild card in sight, wild card in sight


[Verse 5]

F#m              G                 
Oh I’ll be the one who'll break my heart
Em            A                 F#m
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
            G                   A
I'll be the one who'll break my heart
A                       
I'll end it, though you started it


[Outro]

D             G       G    Bm
  The truth lies
D              G      G    Bm
   The truth lied
D             G       G    Bm
  And Lies Divide
D              G       G   Bm
     Lies Divide   Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh OH

End on D
