Intro: G | D | G | D | G | D | A | D

D                  G
Mama said don't go near that river
D                                   A
Don't be hangin' around old catfish John
D                        G
But come the morning I'd always be there
D                           A           D
Walking in his footsteps in sweet delta dawn.

1. D      G                D
Take me back to  another morning
      G             D
And a time so long ago
         G               D
When the sweet magnolias blossomed
                 A                 D
And the cotton fields were white as snow.

2. D       G                D
Catfish John was a river hobo
             G                 D
He lived and died on the river bend
         G              D
Thinkin' back I still remember
         A            D
I was proud to be his friend.

3.       G                    D
Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
       G              D
Traded for a chestnut mare
      G                     D
Oh He never spoke a word in anger
             A              D
Though his load was hard to bear.
