[Verse]
D                  A
 Outside there's a box car waiting
Em           G
 Outside the family store
D           A
 Out by the fire breathing
Em           G     
 Outside we wait 'til face turns blue
D           A
 I know the nervous walking
Em          G
 I know the dirty beard hangs
D           A
 Out by the box car waiting
Em               G
 Take me away to nowhere plains


Bm                  G
 There is a wait so long (So long)
    A                     D
(So long)You never wait so long


G    A               D
     Here comes your man
G    A               D
     Here comes your man
G    A               
     Here comes your man       
[Solo]
D  A  Em  G (x1)

D                 A
 Big shake on the box car moving
Em                G
 Big shake to the land that's falling down
D                  A
 Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
Em                         G
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

Bm                  G
 There is a wait so long (So long)
    A                       D
(So long)You'll never wait so long

[Chorus]
G    A               D
     Here comes your man
G    A               D
     Here comes your man
G    A               D
     Here comes your maaaaaan
G    A               
     Here comes your man

[Solo]
D  A  Em  G (x4)

Bm                  G (or C)
 There is a wait so long (So long)
    A                        D
(So long)You'll never wait so long


[Chorus]- repeat about 14 times...

G    A               D
     Here comes your man
G    A               D
     Here comes your man (add 3 long maaaaan lines + 1 shorty)
