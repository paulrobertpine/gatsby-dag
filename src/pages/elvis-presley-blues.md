Elvis Presley Blues


Elvis Presley Blues - Gillian Welch / David Rawlings
Time (The Revelator) - song 7
Capo 7(D  D7  G   D   Bm   A)
(G7) = (3 x 3 0/2  0 1/0)

CHORUS
(G) I was thinking that night about Elvis
The day that he died, the day that he (G7) died
(G) I was thinking that night about Elvis
The day that he died, the day that he (G7) died

Just a (G) country boy that combed his hair, 
and (C) put on the shirt that his mother made
And (G) went on the air. 
And he (Em) shook it like a chorus (G) girl. 
And he (A/D) shook it like a Harlem (G) queen. 
And he (Em) shook it like a midnight (G) rambler, baby, 
Like you (C) never seen, never (G) seen
Like he never (G7) seen

CHORUS

'Cause he took it all out of black and white
Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he held on tight
And he shook it like a hurricane
And he shook it like to make it break
And he shook it like a holy roller, baby
With his soul at stake

CHORUS

He was all alone in a long decline
Thinking how happy John Henry was
That he fell down and died
When he shook it and it rang like silver
And he shook it and it shine like gold
Well he shook it and it beat that steam drill, baby
Well bless my soul, bless my soul
Well he (Em) shook it and he beat that (G) steam drill, baby
Well (C) bless my soul, what's a wrong with me?

CHORUS

Just a (G) country boy that combed his hair
(C) Put on the shirt his mother made
And he (G) went on the air
And he (Em) shook it like a chorus girl (G)
And he (D) shook it like a Harlem (G) queen
And he (C) shook it like a midnight (G) rambler, baby
Like he (C) never seen, never (G) seen,
Like he never (G7) seen, never (G) seen
