[Verse]

F C                        F C                        F             
  It really breaks my heart, to see a dear old friend
C  G           Am       F     C         
Go down in the worn out place again
F C                    F C                  F
  Do you know the sound, of a closing door?
C        G          Am        F       C     F     
Have you heard that sound somewhere before?
C              G        Am    F      C       G
Do you wonder if she knows you anymore?


[Chorus]

F                                    C
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
 F                                   G
But I never was afraid that it would die
C                  F      Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                                 C    F  C  
But only if you're standing in the eye


[Verse]

F C                         F  C                        F
  Where did you learn to walk, where did you learn to run?
C  G      Am   F         C         
Away from everything you love
F C                         F   C                        F    
  And did you think the bottle, would ever ease your pain?
C     G              Am       F       C   F      
Did you think that love's a foolish game?
        C        G     Am     F        C     G
Did you find someone else to take the blame?


[Chorus]

F                                    C
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
 F                                   G
But I never was afraid that it would die
C                  F      Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                                 C
But only if you're standing in the eye


[Post-Chorus]

C                  F      Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                                 C
But only if you're standing in the eye

[Break]

[Verse]

F C                F  C                        F
  I am a sturdy soul, and there ain't no shame
C  G      Am         F       C    F
In lying down in the bed you made
        C          G      Am      F        C     G
Can you fight the urge to run for another day?
                  Am    G                 C
You might make it further if you learn to stay

[Chorus]

F                                    C
I wrapped your love around me like a chain
 F                                   G
But I never was afraid that it would die
C                  F      Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                                 G    C
But only if you're standing in the eye

[Outro]
                   F      Am
You can dance in a hurricane
Am                                 C
But only if you're standing in the eye
