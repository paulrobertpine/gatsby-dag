Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

F            G7 (or F#o)            C      Am7
When he went away, the blues walked in and met me
F           G7                C          Am7
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
F           G7             C         Am7
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
A7          D7       G7
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
All I have in life is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time
