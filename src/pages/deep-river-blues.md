[Chorus - play after each verse again]
Let it rain,let it pour, 
Let it rain a whole lot more, 
'Cause I got them deep river blues. 
Let the rain drive right on, 
Let the waves sweep along, 
'Cause I got them deep river blues. 

[E7]My old gal's [Eflat6]a good old pal, 
[E7]And she looks like a water fowl, 
[A]When I get them deep river [E]blues.
[E7]Ain't no one to cry for me, 
[E7]And the fish all go out on a spree 
[A]When I get them deep river [E]blues. [B7]  (â†’slide up one fret) [B7]

[E7]Give me back [Eflat6]my old boat, 
[E7]I'm gonna sail if she'll float, 
[A]'Cause I got them deep river [E]blues, 
[E7]I'm goin' back to Muscle Shoals, 
[E7]Times are better there I'm told, 
[A]Cause I got them deep river [E]blues. [B7] 

[E7]If my boat [Eflat6]sinks with me. 
[E7]I'll go down, don't you see, 
[A]'Cause I got them deep river [E]blues, 
[E7]Now I'm gonna say goodbye, 
[E7]And if I sink, just let me die, 
[A]'Cause I got them deep river [E]blues. [B7]
