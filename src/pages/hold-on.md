Intro, D, 4 bars

D .                 G ...
They hung a sign up in our town
        A7 .                  D ...
"if you live it up, you won't live it down"
    D .            G ...
So, she left Monte Rio, son
A7 .               D ...   ....
Just like a bullet leaves a gun
         G   .             A7 ...
With her charcoal eyes and Monroe hips
             D .            G ... ....
She went and took that California trip
      Em .                   A7 ...
Well, the moon was gold, her Hair like wind
         Em .                 A7 .
She said don't look back just Come on Jim
.. ..
Oh you've got to

[Chorus]

D.        A7.       
Hold on, Hold on
D.          G.
You got to hold on
D.                A7.  
Take my hand, I'm standing right here
D... ....          
You gotta hold on

[Verse]
      D .           G ...
Well, he gave her a dimestore watch
A7 .            D...
And a ring made from a spoon
D .                     G ...
Everyoneâ€™s looking for someone to blame
A7  .                      D ... ....          
When you share my bed, you share my name
G .                 A7 ...
Well, go ahead and call the cops
D .                          G ... ....
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
Em .             A7 ...
She said baby, I still love you
Em .              A7 .
Sometimes there's nothin left to do
.. ..
Oh but you've got to


[Chorus]
D        A7       
Hold on, hold on
D          G
Baby got to hold on
D             A7      
Take my hand, I'm standing right here, you got to
D ... ....        
You gotta hold on.

[Verse]
D.          G...
Down by the Riverside motel,
A7.               D...
It's 10 below and falling
D.      G ...               
By the 99 cent store
    A7.                 D... ....
she closed her eyes and started swaying
    G.              A7 ...
But it's so hard to dance that way
D.                            G... ..    
When it's cold and there's no music
          Em .               A7...
Well your old hometown is so far away
     Em.                        A7..
But, inside your head there's a record playing,
..
a song called

[Chorus]
D        A7
Hold on, hold on
D           G
Baby got to hold on
D                 A7
Take my hand, I'm standing right (t)here
D
You gotta hold on.
