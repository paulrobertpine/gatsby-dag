Am          G            F                  C 
When the day got long as it does about now

Am              G                   F                C 
I'd hear him singing to his muley cow

 C           Cadd9             C                Csus 
Calling, "Come on my sweet old girl,


I'd bet the whole damn world

         C                  Dm       C/ E                        G Gsus G   
 That we're gonna make it yet to the end of the road"


             Am        G                    F          C  
Singing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind

Am        G                     F           C          
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Bessie

Am          G                  F          G             C    Cmaj7
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more



                 Am          G         F        C  
Said it's a mean old world, heavy in need

Am         G                         F               C   
That big machine is just a picking up speed

                 Am              G                         F               C  
They were supping on tears, they were supping on wine

Am            G             F         C  
We all get to heaven in our own sweet time

 C           Cadd9             C                Csus 
So come all you Asheville boys

'n turn up your old-time noise
    C                  Dm       C/E                                      G Gsus G  
'n kick 'til the dust comes up from the cracks in the floor

             Am        G                    F          C           
Singing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, brother

Am        G            F                    C   
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind

Am        G              F                   G              C          
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more


              Am           G           F       C  
But the camptown man, he doesn't plow no more

Am         G                   F         C   
I seen him walking down to the superette store

                Am          G                   F             C  
Guess he lost that knack and he forgot that song

Am          G               F        C  
Woke up one morning and the mule was gone



 C           Cadd9             C                Csus 
So come all you ragtime kings,

'n come on you dogs and sing

'n pick up the dusty old horn and give it a blow

        Am        G            F       C          
Playing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, honey

Am        G            F       C         
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, sugar

Am        G            F       G       C          
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind no more
